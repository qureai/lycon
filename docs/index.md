# Lycon

A minimal and fast image library for Python and C++.

Lycon is a small subset of optimized image operations derived from [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

Current set of features include:

- Reading and writing JPEG and PNG images
- Fast SIMD optimized image resizing
- Zero-copy interop with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) whenever possible

Tested on:

- Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) with Python`2.7.6` and `3.5.2`.
- macOS (Sierra, 10.12) with Python `2.7.11` and `3.5.1`.


## API

Check out [API](api.md)


## Install

```
pip install lycon
```

Native extension dependencies:

- CMake 2.8 or newer
- C++ toolchain
- LibJPEG
- LibPNG

### Ubuntu

Single-line command for installing all dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libjpeg-dev libpng-dev
```

### Anaconda

When working within an Anaconda Python distribution, it is recommended to use the latest `cmake` version (`3.6` or newer). Older versions can lead to a mismatch between the `libpng` and `libjpeg` headers used to build Lycon (usually the system headers), and the linked library (which may be preempted by the Anaconda-scoped version). To install the latest `cmake` version:

```
conda install cmake
```

## Example

```python
import lycon

# Load an image as a numpy array
img = lycon.load('mittens.jpg')
# Resize the image using bicubic interpolation
resized = lycon.resize(img, width=256, height=512, interpolation=lycon.Interpolation.CUBIC)
# Crop the image (like any regular numpy array)
cropped = resized[:100, :200]
# Save the image
lycon.save('cropped-mittens.png', cropped)
```

## Limitations

Compared to other image processing libraries ([OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/), [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)), Lycon offers a very limited set of operations. Intended usages include data loaders for deep learning, mass image resizing, etc.

## Advantages over OpenCV

- Drastically smaller (at the cost of drastically fewer features)
- Python module installable via `pip`
- Images use the more common `RGB` ordering (vs OpenCV's `BGR`)

However, if you already have OpenCV installed, Lycon's advantages are minimal.

## Advantages over PIL(low)

- Faster
- First-class NumPy support
- Full support for floating point images

## Advantages over Scikit-Image

- Drastically faster

## Benchmarks
